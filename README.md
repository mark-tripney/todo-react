# Todo (React)

This is a React-based version of a vanilla-JS Todo app, found [here](https://github.com/mtripney/todo) â€” it's a 'real-app' exercise while teaching myself React.

The intention is that this will have feature parity with the vanilla app, developed alongside each other.

This is a **work in progress**. _Please check back soon!_
